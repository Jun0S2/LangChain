## What is LangChain ?

Use models as black box - so without using Machine Learning theories, developers can use them!

> Chain == Chain of Actions

## Environment Setup

```
pip install langchain
pip install langchain-openai
pip install langchain-community
pip install langchainhub
```

## Connecting Prompt

- Prompt : Receive input
- Chat Models : Interact with LLM

```
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```

### What are Chains ?

Allow us to `combine` multiple chains together and make one application.

## Open Source LLMs

It depends on the task, big models perform better on agent / brain ones but for lighter tasks - usually it performs pretty well

### Ollama

**`Ollama`** is a tool that runs **LLM (Large Language Model) on local environement**

üí° **In Short:** üëâ "Open Source tool allows us to run models like Chat GPT **in local environemnt** "
After installing ollama in OS, install with pip install and play around

```
pip install langchain-ollama
```
